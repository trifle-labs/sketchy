whatup


so this is the parent directory of the sketch repository.

it's accessible at https://sketchy.trifle.life.

that's the root of the project so it's showing the contents of the root project, probably we should put (or already have) an index.html file with a list of the other projects : )

when you have another project, just drag the folder with the name of the path you want to use.

so a project called "balls" should go into a folder called "balls" that sits in this root directory then it should be available at https://sketchy.trifle.life/balls.

make issues if you have any ISSUES
